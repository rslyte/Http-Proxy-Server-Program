Programming Project: Http Proxy Server

Tested in Ubuntu 14.04, with Firefox 32, with python 2.7
To run: make sure you have python (2.6 or 2.7 preferably),
   and in the console type 'python HttpProxy.py [preferred port number]'.
   Then configure firefox to use which port you chose on 'localhost' instead of the default proxy settings.

Description: This is a simple http proxy server which uses the python library dictionary to cache page elements for faster browsing. This project was also set up for us to learn http protocol.
